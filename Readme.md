# Mapbox App

This application shares among connected clients the markers after a drag or a creation on a map.

The front-end is developed with React using Mapbox as the map.

The backend is an Express server that uses web sockets (using Socket.io) for real time communicacion with different clients.

This application is based on Fernando Herrera's ticket app for his React + WebSockets course on Udemy. I've developed some code on my own instead of following Fernando's steps because of my ideas about how to improve app code and architecture or because of simple attempts on my own before seeing the official solution.
